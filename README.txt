This Python project was meant to explore the use of the tinify API. The Image Reducer will take any larger sized image and reduce the pixel size to fit within 250 X 60. The tinify API will also compress the image's file size while maintaining quality.

In order to utilize the tinify API, you must register for an API key at https://tinypng.com/developers. This key will need to be entered in the python file before running.

You can learn more about the different features of the API at https://tinypng.com/developers/reference/python.

Their GitHub page is also a great resource. https://github.com/tinify/tinify-python.
